# AudioFile

This is a library for loading audio files.

It is used by many of the applications at https://github.com/Xangis, including
CheckBeat, for loading .wav files to use as audio samples.

It is released under the terms of the MIT license.

# Building

On Windows, use the Visual Studio project to build the library.

On Linux, most projects just compile in the source files that they need.

# Development Status

I actively maintain this library because many of my applications depend on it.
